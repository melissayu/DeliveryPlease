DeliveryPlease
==============

Android application project for CS160: App for crowdsourcing restaurant delivery

This is a final project done for UC Berkeley class CS160:User Interfaces, in a group of 3. It is designed for an Android tablet, so the layout may not be ideal for Android phones. This is currently a working prototype, and not a fully flushed out application.

Summary:
DeliveryPlease crowdsources restaurant delivery between users. A user may place an order by seeing a list of other users who are checked in at local restaurants and sending an order request. Any restaurant has a potential delivery service if another DeliveryPlease user is there. The delivering user can set their own fee for delivery service.

Current features:
- Check into a location
- View orders
- Set terms for delivery
- Interactive menus
- Review delivery options
- Rate users
